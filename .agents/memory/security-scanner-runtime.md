name: Security scanner runtime boundaries
description: Temporary-storage quotas, native versus direct Pro authorization, and streaming very large privacy reports.

Treat scanner runtime failures separately from application findings. Use the
managed scanner first. If system temporary storage fails, a local CLI can use
workspace-local scratch/cache paths; HoundDog may also need a process-scoped
workspace-local HOME. Do not change the app's HOME or shared credentials to fix
a scanner.

**Why:** System temporary-directory quotas broke scanners, browser startup and
workflow helpers while the workspace volume remained writable. HoundDog's
direct CLI completed only with isolated scratch/cache/home storage.

**How to apply:** Scope temporary environment changes to the scanner subprocess,
keep generated reports ignored, and distinguish a failed tool attempt from a
successfully completed equivalent scan. A successful managed Pro scan does not
mean the separately installed direct Pro binary has authentication; its login
error is not evidence that the managed scanner is unavailable.

Stream large privacy report summaries instead of loading their whole JSON into
Node memory.

**Why:** A full privacy report exceeded Node's 2 GiB Buffer limit, despite having
very few flagged flows. Data-element occurrences can dominate report size.

**How to apply:** Use a streaming JSON parser for counts/severities and retain
raw reports only in ignored generated-output storage. Do not dump occurrence
content or credentials into chat while summarizing scan results.
